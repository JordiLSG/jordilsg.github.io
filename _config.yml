  With nine years of experience in Unity game development, I've had the privilege of being one of the co-creators of Everhood, a project made in collaboration with a Mojang artist. 
  I was responsible for handling all coding aspects, from crafting tools to implementing gameplay mechanics.
  I also had the chance to work on a mobile game Yippy Solitaire that features a Solitaire Tripeaks Gameplay.
  Currently, on my free time, I'm a working on the sequel, Everhood 2, where I aim to continue refining my skills in Unity programming to create an enjoyable experience for players.
