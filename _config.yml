  Nine years of experience in Unity game development, co-creator of Everhood, a project made in collaboration with a Mojang artist. 
  Responsible for handling all coding aspects, from crafting tools to implementing gameplay mechanics.
  Worked on a mobile game Yippy Solitaire that features a Solitaire Tripeaks Gameplay.
  I'm now working on my free time on Everhood 2, where I aim to continue refining my skills in Unity programming to create an enjoyable experience for players.
